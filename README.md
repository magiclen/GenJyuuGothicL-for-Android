GenJyuuGothicL and GenJyuuGothicL-P for Android
===============================================

Font `GenJyuuGothic` is also known as `思源柔黑體` in Chinese and `源柔ゴシック` in Japanese. It is a JP based CJK font made from `Source Han Sans`.

`GenJyuuGothicL` is slightly different to `GenJyuuGothicL-P`. The "P" means "Proportional". It should let text look better than "no P".

After installing the font APKs `GenJyuuGothicL.apk` and `GenJyuuGothicL-P.apk`, you can find `思源柔黑體(L)` and `思源柔黑體(LP)` in your font type setting.

If you want to use `GenJyuuGothic` on computers, download the font files from [the official website](http://jikasei.me/font/genjyuu/).
